ALTBITADDRESSGEN
=============

Universal JavaScript Client-Side altcoin Wallet Generator (Multiple crypto-currency)

Now all altcoin addresses and their corresponding private keys can be conveniently 
generated in a web browser.

The ALTBITADDRESSGEN project provides an all-in-one HTML document with embedded
JavaScript/Css/Images. The JavaScript is readable not minified and contains no
XMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX). The benefit of this technique is you can load the 
JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being 
loaded.


END USER NOTES:
---------------

 1) For Bulk Wallet I recommended using Google Chrome, it's the fastest.

 2) Requires IE9+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.

 3) Mobile Safari only works with iPhone4 or newer devices.
    Older devices timeout while executing JavaScript.

 4) DO NOT use Opera Mini it renders JavaScript output server side, therefore
    they might record the private key you generated.

 5) BIP38 most likely will not work on mobile devices due to hardware limitations.
 
 6) Art Wallet does not work properly in IE8 due to CSS limitations.
 
 7) To print QRCode in IE8 you must enable the "Print Background Colors and Images" checkbox on the "Page Setup" screen.
